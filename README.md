Messing around with Generative Adversarial Networks

Referenced [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-super-simple-gan-in-pytorch-54ba349920e4) for GAN concept for generating even integers in the closed interval [0,127]

More robust convergence using Wasserstein Loss described in [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf). Other sources cited in the colab notebook.

More descriptive README as well as code reorganization into files planned for the future.
