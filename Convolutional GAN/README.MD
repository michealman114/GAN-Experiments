Starting work on a convolutional GAN to generate images. Starting with simple standard datasets such as CIFAR10 and MNIST.

Currently working on optimizing the architecture and hyperparameters to produce better images.

As of 11/03/2022, the model generates the following images:

Promising results at epoch 8.

Further training causes the model to stabilize at this output.
